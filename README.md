## Examples

Three example configurations are included in the Examples folder.
All three examples also use the **xSQLServer** and **xSCVMM** modules.

### Single Server Installation

SCSPF-SingleServer.ps1 installs SPF including prerequisites and SQL on a single server.

### Separate SQL

SCSPF-SeperateSQL.ps1 installs SPF on one server and SQL on a separate server.

### Multiple Instances
SCSPF-MultiInstance.ps1 installs multiple SPF servers each on their own server and SQL on a separate server.

Notes:

The samples require the use of [Windows Management Framework (WMF) 5.0 Preview](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=398175).

All three examples use the exact same Configuration and just modify the behavior based on input ConfigurationData.

In the Examples folder you will see a version of each file with "-TP" appended to the name.
These are the equivalent examples for deployment of System Center Technical Preview on Windows Server Technical Preview.
